## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

### 1. Create the Database & Table
Creates a new database `ecommerce_db` and a `transactions` table with columns like user name, age, country, product category, purchase amount, payment method, and transaction date.


CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ecommerce_db;
USE ecommerce_db;
2. Load Data
Loads CSV data into the table:


LOAD DATA INFILE '.../ecommerce_transactions.csv' ...

SQL Queries and Their Purpose

SELECT SUM(Purchase_Amount) AS Total_Sales FROM transactions;
Calculates the total sales value.

üìä Grouping & Aggregation

SELECT Country, AVG(Purchase_Amount) FROM transactions GROUP BY Country;
Shows average purchase per country.


SELECT Product_Category, SUM(Purchase_Amount) FROM transactions GROUP BY Product_Category;
Total sales per product category.

üîé Filter Queries

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE Payment_Method = 'PayPal';
Finds all PayPal transactions.


SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE Age > 40;
Lists customers over 40 years old.

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE Purchase_Amount > (SELECT AVG(Purchase_Amount) FROM transactions);
Filters transactions above average value.

üß† Views

CREATE VIEW top_buyers AS
SELECT User_Name, SUM(Purchase_Amount) AS Total_Spent
FROM transactions
GROUP BY User_Name
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC;
View showing top buyers by total spending.


CREATE VIEW country_sales AS
SELECT Country, SUM(Purchase_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM transactions
GROUP BY Country;
View for sales grouped by country.

‚öôÔ∏è Indexes

CREATE INDEX idx_country ON transactions(Country);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_category ON transactions(Product_Category);
Speeds up queries that filter or group by country or product category.

Check indexes with:


SHOW INDEXES FROM transactions;
üìà Advanced Analysis
Monthly Sales Trend

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Transaction_Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(Purchase_Amount) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM transactions
GROUP BY Month;
Age Group Behavior

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN Age < 20 THEN 'Under 20'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN '20s'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30s'
    WHEN Age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40s'
    ELSE '50+'
  END AS Age_Group,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Transactions,
  SUM(Purchase_Amount) AS Total_Spent
FROM transactions
GROUP BY Age_Group;
High-Volume Buyers

SELECT User_Name, COUNT(*) AS Total_Transactions
